# 3D Head
## Technologies Used
Autodesk Maya: For the complete design of the head 
## Challenges
This project was incredibly tasking as I had a hard time making the area around the eyes curve more naturally.
## Future improvements 
Focus more on the front profile earlier on in the modeling process, then move on to the side profile as I was modeling mainly the side which resulted in the front of the head not looking as good as it should.
